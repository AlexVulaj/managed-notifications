  "description": "Your cluster requires you to take action because the file descriptors limit for worker node ${NODE} is currently at 90%, the kernel is predicted to exhaust file descriptors limit soon, resulting in applications on the node being no longer able to open and operate on files. Without action, your cluster's SLA may be impacted, along with your ability to upgrade. Please reduce the number of files opened simultaneously by either adjusting application configuration or by moving some applications to other nodes.",
